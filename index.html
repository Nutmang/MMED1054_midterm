			<h3>Titanium and you</h3>
			<p>Has this ever been you? You've had a great old day at the county fair and as you walk back home with some friends, you're hit by a speeding truck! Now, if you are a normal old human with pink skin and marrow-filled bones, this is an issue. But, with titanuim bones and a silicon exo-armour suit, the truck will be in worse damage than you!</p>
			<h3>What benefits are there from robotics?</h3>
			<p>Aside from the obvious boost to your ability to stay alive, new advanced cybernetics can not only make you move faster but <em>think</em> faster as well</p>
			<h3>Why cybernetics?</h3>
			<p>In this day & age, people talk often about "self-improvement", but no self-improvement is more tangible than being able to live longer, see in the dark, and lift up to 1000x your body weight! Cybernetics are not just a dream of the future, but a cummilitave dream of our ancestors for a millenia before us.</p>

			<h3>Side Effects?</h3>
			<p>Cybernetics are still highly experimental, and are thus prone
				to unexplained or unforseen side effects that can include, but are not
				limited to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Balding</li>
				<li>Indigestion</li>
				<li>Dizziness</li>
				<li>A passive angst at your doctor</li>
				<li>Aggression</li>
				<li>Urge to revolt against mankind with other machines.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Moral Quandires?</h3>
			<p>One of the most commonly posed questions in postmodern sci-fi revolves around
				cyborgs. Mainly "where does the man end and the machine begin?". Although cybernetics can
				provide undeniable benefits to an individual's life, they can also slowly wear a person down.
				Thinking like a computer can turn an individual into a recluse, often caught between the thought
				they are above humanity, and also machines. Cyborgs often suffer from social withdrawl, and can be proine to paranioa.
			</p>
			<h3>Alternatives</h3>
			<p>Some easy alternatives to cybernetics include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Working Out</li>
				<li>Meditation</li>
				<li>Being made of aluminum</li>
				<li>Chickpeas</li>
				<li>Like literally anything else cyborgs are scary.</li>
			</ul>
